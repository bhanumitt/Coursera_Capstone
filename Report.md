# Analysis of Restaurants in Mumbai 

## Introduction

Mumbai is a bustling city in India. The diversity of the city can be seen by the food the city offers. Various cuisines with Parsi, Gujrati, South Indian, Muslim, and Maharastrian influence, Mumbai is a heaven for the taste buds. The street food here is as delicious as the food you get in a high end restaurant. So you can relish the food here without it being heavy on the pocket. 

In the metropolitan city there are various street food hotspots and high end places which are doing quite well for themselves. So, the question that arises for a person opening a new restaurant is where should he open one? What type of food is more prevalent and wanted by the people? Should it be near offices or not? What demographic should he focus on? Usually, answering these questions can be overwhelming and the answers are mostly speculative. But today with the help of data, we can get quite an accurate idea of what to expect from a neighborhood. 

## Data

To solve the problem, I have taken the latitude and longitude of [major neighborhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Mumbai#Antop_Hill) of Mumbai and also, the [commercial property rate](https://www.mumbaipropertyexchange.com/research/mumbai-property-rates) (per sqft.) there. The coordinates will help to find the popular food hotspots near that area and the rates will guide as to how costly can the venture be.
